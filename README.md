# 🌟 Supervised Machine Learning Labs 🧠

## 📖 Aperçu / Overview

Bienvenue aux **Supervised Machine Learning Labs**! 🎉 This repository contains a collection of hands-on labs designed to explore **supervised machine learning** techniques and algorithms. Supervised learning is a cornerstone of machine learning where models are trained on labeled data to predict outcomes or classify data points. Here, we dive into practical implementations, including an **ensemble d'algorithmes** (ensemble of algorithms) to boost performance and accuracy.

### ✨ Objectifs / Goals
- 🧑‍💻 Master core supervised learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- 🤝 Explore **ensemble methods** (e.g., Bagging, Boosting, Random Forests) to combine multiple models for better predictions.
- 📊 Visualize data and model performance with tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- ⚙️ Tune hyperparameters and evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The current date is **March 31, 2025**, and this project is built with the latest tools and techniques as of that time.
